# apatton33-SocailNetwork-API

## Description

I was Challengee to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list useing Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition I used express and Mongoose packages.
No seed data provided, so I needed to create my own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.

## Usage

When you enter in the scripts to start the application and run the server, you can then go to insomnia
and run GET, Post, Put, and DELETE tests for the information that is formatted in JSON. 
There is tests for both Users and Thoughts as seen in the walkthrough video.
